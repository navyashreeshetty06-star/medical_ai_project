    <h1 style="text-align: center;"><u>🌐Medical AI X-Ray Analyzer</u></h1>
<h3><u>1. Who We Are</u></h3>
<p >Medical AI X-Ray Analyzer is a next-generation healthcare technology initiative built to empower diagnostic efficiency using Artificial Intelligence. Our system focuses on one key medical challenge — rapid and accurate detection of Pneumonia using chest X-ray images. We are a team of passionate developers, data scientists, and healthcare enthusiasts committed to bridging the gap between technology and medicine.
Our goal is to create accessible, affordable, and reliable AI solutions that assist doctors, improve patient outcomes, and redefine clinical workflows.</p>

<h3><u>2. Our Mission</u></h3>
<h4><u>Our mission is simple:</u></h4>
<ul><li>To use AI to save lives.</li></ul>   
We aim to support hospitals and clinics by providing fast AI-based analysis, especially in places where trained radiologists are limited.</p>

<h3><u>3. Why We Built This System</u></h3>
<p>Today, Pneumonia remains one of the leading causes of child mortality. Many hospitals do not have radiologists available 24/7, and manual diagnosis can take time. With AI, the analysis becomes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Instant </li>
<li>Consistent</li>
<li>Highly accurate</li>
<li>Always available</li>
 </ul>
<p>This system is designed so that medical professionals can upload an X-ray image and get an immediate prediction.</p>
<h3><u>4. What Our System Does</u></h3>
<p>Our AI model analyzes chest X-ray images and classifies them into:</p>
<br>
<ul><li>NORMAL</li>
<li>PNEUMONIA</li>
 </ul>
<p>The system quickly reads the uploaded image, processes it using deep learning, and predicts the condition with confidence score.</p>
<h3><u>5. Core Features</u></h3>
<ul><li>Fast and automated diagnosis</li>
<li>MobileNet-based deep learning model</li>
<li>High accuracy after training with thousands of images</li>
<li>Simple, user-friendly web interface </li>
<li>Secure image handling </li>
<li>Real-time prediction results</li>
</ul>
<p>Designed for hospitals, clinics, and research purposes</p>
<h3><u>6. Technology Behind the System</u></h3>
<p><u>Our AI model is powered by:</u></p>
<ul><li>Python</li>
<li>TensorFlow / Keras</li>
<li>Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)</li>
<li>MobileNetV2 architecture</li>
<li>Image augmentation</li>
<li>Real-time preprocessing pipelines</li>
</ul>
<p>The system is designed for high accuracy even on limited hardware.</p>
<h3><u>7. Meet the Team</u></h3>
<ul><li>AI Engineer: Responsible for model training & optimization</li>
<li>Backend Developer: Builds Flask backend for prediction</li>
<li>Frontend Developer: UI/UX design of the dashboard</li>
<li>Data Analyst: Ensures correct dataset preparation and balancing</li>
<li>Project Lead: Oversees development and deployment</li>
</ul>
<h3><u>8. Our Vision</u></h3>
<p>We imagine a future where AI assists every medical professional, reducing diagnostic delays and minimizing errors. <br> Our long-term vision includes:</p>
<ul><li>Multi-disease detection</li>
<li>Cloud-based diagnosis</li>
<li>Mobile app for rural medical centers</li>
<li>Integration with hospital systems</li>
</ul>
<h3><u>9. Why Our System is Unique</u></h3>
<ul><li>Lightweight yet powerful</li>
<li>Works even on low-spec computers</li>
<li>Uses advanced transfer learning</li>
<li>High training accuracy</li>
</ul>
<p>Designed specifically for Pneumonia classification</p>
<h3><u>10. Our Commitment</u></h3>
We are committed to:
<ul>
<li>Ethical and responsible AI
</li>
<li>Protecting user privacy
</li>
<li>Improving medical accessibility
</li>
<li>Continuous research and improvement</li>
</ul>
